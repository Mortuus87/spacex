        This page uses the unofficial SpaceX API to present information about the next planned rocket launches SpaceX has 
        planned. It also lists previous launches in a descending order.

      <h2>About SpaceX</h2>
      <p>
        Space Exploration Technologies Corp., trading as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space
        transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with
        the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX has
        developed several launch vehicles, the Starlink satellite constellation, the Dragon cargo spacecraft, and flown
        humans to the International Space Station on the Crew Dragon Demo-2.

        SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in
        2008),[12] the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010),
        the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012),[13] the
        first propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon
        9 in 2017), the first private company to launch an object into orbit around the Sun (Falcon Heavy's payload of a
        Tesla Roadster in 2018), and the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station
        (SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 Mission in 2020). SpaceX has flown 20 cargo resupply missions to the
        International Space Station (ISS) under a partnership with NASA, as well as an uncrewed demonstration flight
        of the human-rated Dragon 2 spacecraft (Crew Demo-1) on March 2, 2019, and the first crewed Dragon 2 flight on
        May 30, 2020.

        In December 2015, a Falcon 9 accomplished a propulsive vertical landing. This was the first such achievement by
        a rocket for orbital spaceflight. In April 2016, with the launch of CRS-8, SpaceX successfully vertically
        landed the first stage on an ocean drone ship landing platform. In May 2016, in another first, SpaceX again
        landed the first stage, but during a significantly more energetic geostationary transfer orbit mission. In
        March 2017, SpaceX became the first to successfully re-launch and land the first stage of an orbital rocket.
        In January 2020, with the third launch of the Starlink project, SpaceX became the largest commercial satellite
        constellation operator in the world.

        In September 2016, Musk unveiled the Interplanetary Transport System—subsequently renamed Starship—a privately
        funded launch system to develop spaceflight technology for use in crewed interplanetary spaceflight. In 2017,
        Musk unveiled an updated configuration of the system which is intended to handle interplanetary missions plus
        become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle after the early 2020s, as SpaceX has announced it intends to
        eventually replace its existing Falcon 9 launch vehicles and Dragon space capsule fleet with Starship, even in
        the Earth-orbit satellite delivery market. Starship is planned to be fully reusable and
        will be the largest rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.
